further improvements to my code for os-independence 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r116375 | cewing | 2010-04-28 17:37:13 -0500 (Wed, 28 Apr 2010) | 2 lines

using a more os-independant way of splitting file/path names

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r116372 | cewing | 2010-04-28 17:07:56 -0500 (Wed, 28 Apr 2010) | 4 lines

adding a sample zipfile with some wonky international filenames so that we can test the 'readFromZip' function against non-english character sets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r116371 | cewing | 2010-04-28 17:06:32 -0500 (Wed, 28 Apr 2010) | 9 lines

* added a new function 'getZipInfoForName' to resolve the potential differences between the identifying resource name extracted from a QTI manifest and the 'name' by which the corresponding file may be read from the ZipFile object being imported.

* refactored the 'readFromZip' function to rely on the new getZipInfoForName method to get the lookup value for reading the desired file from the ZipFile object.

both of these functions now rely on the 'unicodeDecode' python script in Products.ECQuiz.skins.ECQuiz to render lookup values and filenames into unicode strings for the sake of comparison.  This should mean that the results returned are onsistent leading to better matching at all stages of the process.

tests on qti import now work using both a zipfile with a manifest that matches the names in the zipfile information and one where the zipfile information has extra pathname information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r116294 | cewing | 2010-04-27 15:22:27 -0500 (Tue, 27 Apr 2010) | 3 lines

established a single passing test for QTI import of a one-question multiple-choice test.
added a single failing test to demonstrate that QTI import fails for packages that have been zipped with pathnames as part of the zip archive.  The only difference between the two sample zip files is that one was zipped from the location where the manifest file was located, and the other was zipped from the parent folder.  This causes import to fail despite the fact that the package is perfectly valid.

r116292 | cewing | 2010-04-27 13:02:56 -0500 (Tue, 27 Apr 2010) | 2 lines

collect all types missing from portal_factory into a list and report them all out as a single failure rather than failing on the first and skipping the rest.  This helped immensely when figuring out why types were not in the factory tool.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r116291 | cewing | 2010-04-27 13:01:06 -0500 (Tue, 27 Apr 2010) | 2 lines

factor some setup code up to base.py so that I can re-use it in other tests.  Existing tests still pass

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r116290 | cewing | 2010-04-27 12:58:15 -0500 (Tue, 27 Apr 2010) | 2 lines

added other types to factorytool.xml so that existing tests pass.  No guarantee that this won't cause other problems, but I need a clean slate and there aren't any other tests available to help at the moment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r116183 | cewing | 2010-04-26 12:39:42 -0500 (Mon, 26 Apr 2010) | 2 lines

branching to make some changes to the system for importing QTI packaged-quizzes.  The current code does not support zip files with pathnames in them.


# Changes in release 1.2.1 (2010-04-16)

- ECQuiz is now eggified and uploaded to PyPI.  An old-style 
  tarball distribution is still available at plone.org.


# Changes in release 1.2 (2009-01-23)

- Added support for Plone 3 (thanks to Jim Baack and the ITC of the ILO)

- Now requires DataGridField 1.6rc1


# Changes in release 1.1 (2007-07-16)

- New question type: Scale questions can be used for Likert scales and
  similar response types.  Each answer is assigned a certain
  percentage of the total score for the question.  Scale questions can
  be displayed horizontally or vertically.

- New "Quick Edit" function: Quick Edit enables you to quickly edit a
  complete quiz in textual form or to create it offline in a text
  editor.

- Initial check-in of some unit tests for ECQuiz

- Fixed bug #126: imsmanifest.xml files are now valid wrt the XML
  Schema.

- Several other bug fixes

- Compatibility with DataGridField 1.5

- Italian translation

# Changes in release 1.0 (2006-09-11)

- New management of test results

- References to questions and question groups from other tests

- Tutor-graded questions

- Extended text questions (always tutor-graded)

- Each question/question group can be placed on a separate page;
  navigation between pages can be disabled

- Grading scale, allowing you to map test scores to grades (or other
  categories)

- Slovenian translation
